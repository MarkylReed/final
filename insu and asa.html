			I met him when I was thirteen.

			He scared the shit out of me.

			I was used to being able to read people. I could read facial expressions and body language like a natural tongue, with all their little gestures.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			I couldn't read him and it terrified me. I was scared of messing up. I was trying so hard to find what he wanted me to be so I could fit it-- and it never worked.
		</name>

			It changed when I caught him crying.

			Asa isn't very expressive. He struggles with "performing" emotions. Seeing him cry was... different.

			I rubbed his back and led him through breathing until he calmed down. He opened up to me about his anxiety, and a few other things.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			I calmed down. Not because I suddenly knew what to do, but because I understood him. It took trial and error, but I eventually found a routine with him, and he let me take care of him. He <i>trusted me</i> with all of the little unsavory bits of himself.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			He taught me that I didn't have to perform for everyone. It's a lesson I'm still learning, but he reminds me of it constantly. It's hard to miss with him.
