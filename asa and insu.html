			I met him when I was seventeen.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			He was just thirteen, and he had just moved to the US from Korea.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			He and his mom were escaping his dad. His mom and my mom were roommates back in college, so they kept in contact by being pen pals.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			My mom helped his mom move here, and they lived in the other half of our duplex. I was asked to be his babysitter.

	<div>
		<name>
			I hated the little shit at first.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			I hated how clingy he was, and I hated how much he cried, and I hated that he really couldn't do anything for himself.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			I don't remember what changed it all. None of those things even remotely bother me now. Maybe it was just me being a teenager?
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			I don't know. I remember eventually warming up to him, and we were inseparable. 
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			We did everything together. I taught him Japanese and he taught me Korean. I helped him with his science classes and he helped me with my writing classes. We went on trips together, we hung out together after school, anything we could do together, we did.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			We even went to the same college.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			He was just coming in when I was graduating, but we lived in an apartment together while I started med school and he finished undergrad.
