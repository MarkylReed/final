			I fell in love with him.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			I never intended too. But I did. I fell in love with him bit by bit. I fell in love with him when he cooed to me, and I fell in love with him when he held me.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			I can't imagine not being with him. I <i>need</i> him, now. I need him next to me when I sleep, I need to hear his voice, I need to touch his hands or his face. 
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			I've never been allowed to be selfish with someone, and I want to be selfish with him. He's the first person to not treat me like a broken record, and he's the only person that made me feel human.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			I never understood romantic attraction until I was deep in it with him. I never understood why people would move mountains for give up life changing opportunities until I realized that I would do it all for him.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			What do you call that other than love? In-Su has always been there for me, and I'll always be there for him. We haven't always agreed, but I appreciate that he's patient with me, and that he's willing to communicate with me in a way others don't.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			He doesn't treat me like im stupid. Even when I'm melting down, or in a panic attack, or trying to explain why I feel like if we do something, we'll die. He always treats me with unmatched kindness and compassion.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			I never meant to love him but...
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			I love him and there's <i><a href="index.html">nothing I can do about it.</a></i>
