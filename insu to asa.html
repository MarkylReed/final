			I fell for him in my senior year of high school.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			Or, I realized I loved him. I'd dated around, and I didn't have a shortage of popularity. I just wasn't satisfied in any relationship. I thought it was just because I was in high school and I expected things to change or not to last.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			It wasn't until I thought that Asa liked someone else that I realized my feelings for him. 
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			There was this guy in one of his classes, I think it was <i>- <a href="simon 1.html">Simon Ellis </a>-</i>.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			He and Asa spent so much time together that, for the first time in years, he'd stopped seeing me for almost two weeks straight. By the end of the second week, I felt like I was dying.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			It hit me then that I loved him. I couldn't bear not being with him, and I couldn't bear the thought of him giving someone else the attention and doting care that he gave me. 
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			I thought that feeling would leave. I was wrong.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			Eventually, I told him. He reciprocated. We tried dating, but neither of us felt truly comfortable in that label.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			I love him in a way that these contrived notions of romance can't describe. I feel comfortable with the label we have chosen though--
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			<i>He is mine.</i>
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			it's simple. He's mine and I'm his. I know Asa feels uncomfortable with us being a couple because he thinks he's a burden and that I can do better, but I want him and him alone. I can't imagine not being with him.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			I'm the real selfish one-- playing by these games instead of being more direct. But, I don't want to push his comfortability. I want him relaxed. He deserves it.
		</name>
	</div>
	<div>
		<name>
			It's simple, really.<i><a href="index.html">I love him.</a></i>
