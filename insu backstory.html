			My mom is a secretary now. I don't know what she did there, if she did do anything there. I don't think my dad let her.

			Meeting Asa was one of the best things to ever happen to me. I know he couldn't stand me at first, but I learned to not take it personally. Asa is just afraid of being hurt. I understand that fear.

			In addition to meeting Asa, I got to make some other friends like <i>- <a href="kavel 1.html">Kavel Anderson</a> -</i>, and now I get lunch sometimes with an intern named <i>- <a href="kaylah 1.html">Kaylah Shin</a> -</i>.
